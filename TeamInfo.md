## Project Title
SafeTravelLA

## Project Summary

Our project aims to bring safer and more confortable experience for our user to travel in Los Angeles. We utilize the "Crime in Los Angeles Data from 2020 to Present" database (Provided by: Los Angeles Police Department) to create some practical tools that anyone can use. We place most emphasis on the visualization on the crime occurrence and safe travelling path both in time-scale and space-scale.

## Functionalities
We plan to implement these key functionalities in our project: 
1. **Rank and Present Los Angeles' High-Risk Neighborhoods:** Create a chart that ranks neighborhoods in Los Angeles based on the frequency of criminal activities. This will help our website users make informed decisions about which areas to avoid.
2. **Identify and Present Peak Crime Periods in Los Angeles:** Analyze crime data to pinpoint the times when crime rates in Los Angeles are unusually high. This analysis aims to uncover potential correlations between public safety and social events or public festivals, enabling our users to plan their visits accordingly.
3. **Highlight the Most Common Types of Crimes in Los Angeles:** Display a list of the most prevalent crimes committed in Los Angeles. This information will assist users in understanding what to be vigilant about when visiting the city.
4. **Enhance User Experience with Music:** Enhance user engagement and enjoyment on our website by incorporating music.
5. **Copyrights and Acknowledgements:** Provide appropriate copyright information and acknowledgments for any content used on our website.
6. **Offer Additional Safety Tips for Los Angeles:** Include contact information for local police departments and offer other safety recommendations for visitors to Los Angeles.

Moreover, we try to develop these interesting functions on our website:
1. Using geometrical crime data mentioned above, we try to develop a safe-walk system that output a automatically generated shortest path between the user-input source and destination, avoiding dangerous neighborhood in LA. 
2. Using location data of where criminal activities happened, we try to draw a map of LA with red dots on it indicating where crimes has been commited. The denser the dots are, the more dangerous the neighborhood is. 

"SafetyWaveLA" is a comprehensive platform designed to proactively address the safety concerns of Los Angeles residents and travellesrs. By providing secure route planning, safety zone and road delineation, and Crime Peak Analysis, our project contributes to the creation of a safer, more informed, and resilient city.
