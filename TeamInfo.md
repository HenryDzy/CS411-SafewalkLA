## Project Title
SafeTravelLA

## Project Summary

Our project aims to offer our users better access to a safer and more confortable experience while travelling in Los Angeles. We utilize the "Crime in Los Angeles Data from 2020 to Present" database ([Source: Los Angeles Police Department](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8)) to create some practical tools that anyone can use. We place most emphasis on the visualization on the crime occurrence and safe travelling path both in time-scale and space-scale. However, our platform will also serve our users in more aspects. Other safety tips not covered by the dataset and useful information regarding safe travelling in Los Angeles will be integrated in our platform. We are committed to creating a comprehensive webtool that ensures our users a secure and enjoyable experience while exploring the city.

## Functionalities
### Basic Functionalities
We plan to implement these key functionalities in our project: 
1. **Rank and Present Los Angeles' High-Risk Neighborhoods:** Create a chart that ranks neighborhoods in Los Angeles based on the frequency of criminal activities. This will help our website users make informed decisions about which areas to avoid.
2. **Identify and Present Peak Crime Periods in Los Angeles:** Analyze crime data to pinpoint the times when crime rates in Los Angeles are unusually high. This analysis aims to uncover potential correlations between public safety and social events or public festivals, enabling our users to plan their visits accordingly.
3. **Highlight the Most Common Types of Crimes in Los Angeles:** Display a list of the most prevalent crimes committed in Los Angeles. This information will assist users in understanding what to be vigilant about when visiting the city.
4. **Enhance User Experience with Music:** Enhance user engagement and enjoyment on our website by incorporating music.
5. **Copyrights and Acknowledgements:** Provide appropriate copyright information and acknowledgments for any content used on our website.
6. **Offer Additional Safety Tips for Los Angeles:** Include contact information for local police departments and offer other safety recommendations for visitors to Los Angeles.
### Extend Functionalities
Additionally, we endeavor to create the following valuable features on our website:
1. **Reassuring Navigation:** Utilizing the geometric crime data referenced earlier, we are working towards the development of a secure walking system. This system will automatically generate the shortest path between a user-input source and destination while avoiding high-risk neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
2. **Danger Level Visualization:** Leveraging location data related to criminal incidents, we aim to construct a map of Los Angeles that visually highlights areas with red dots denoting crime occurrences. The density of these dots will serve as an indicator of neighborhood danger levels.

"SafeTravelLA" is a comprehensive platform designed to proactively address the safety concerns of Los Angeles residents and travelers. By providing secure route planning, safety zone and road delineation, and Crime Peak Analysis, our project contributes to the creation of a safer, more informed, and more resilient travelling service platform.
