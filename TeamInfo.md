## Project Title
SafewalkLA

## Project Summary

Our project aims to offer our users better access to a safer and more confortable experience while travelling in Los Angeles. We utilize the "Crime in Los Angeles Data from 2020 to Present" database ([Source: Los Angeles Police Department](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8)) to create some practical tools that anyone can use. We place most emphasis on the visualization on the crime occurrence and safe travelling path both in time-scale and space-scale. However, our platform will also serve our users in more aspects. Other safety tips not covered by the [dataset](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8) and useful information regarding safe travelling in Los Angeles will be integrated in our platform. We are committed to creating a comprehensive webtool that ensures our users a secure and enjoyable experience while exploring the city.

"SafeTravelLA" is a comprehensive platform designed to proactively address the safety concerns of Los Angeles residents and travelers. By providing secure route planning, safety zone and road delineation, and Crime Peak Analysis, our project contributes to the creation of a safer, more informed, and more resilient travelling service platform.
