## Project Summary

Our project aims to bring safer and more confortable experience for our user to travel in Los Angeles. We utilize the "Crime in Los Angeles Data from 2020 to Present" database(Provided by: Los Angeles Police Department) to create some practical tools that anyone can use. We place most emphasis on the visualization on the crime occurrence and safe travelling path both in time-scale and space-scale.

There are three key functionalities: 
###### Secure Route Planning
###### Safety Zone and Road Delineation
###### Crime Peak Analysis
"SafetyWaveLA" is a comprehensive platform designed to proactively address the safety concerns of Los Angeles residents and travellesrs. By providing secure route planning, safety zone and road delineation, and Crime Peak Analysis, our project contributes to the creation of a safer, more informed, and resilient city.
