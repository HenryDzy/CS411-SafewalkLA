  We have achieved a state of normalization up to the Third Normal Form (3NF) for our database schema. 
  In the original table, all attributes are individual and exhibit a functional dependency on the DR_NO. Nevertheless, there exist redundancies within the table, such as the relationship between weapon_desc and weapon_used_cd, both of which are present in the original table. 
  To address this, we have separated these two attributes into a new table, where weapon_used_id serves as the primary key, and weapon_desc now has a functional dependency directly on weapon_used_id. 
  We have repeated this process for other similar sets of redundant attributes. Through this practice of decomposing a large table into smaller components, we are ensuring that our database adheres to the principles of the 3NF.
